# Predicting Customers'Brand Preference Using Classification models

## 1. Project overview 

### 1.1 Skill sets required

This project investigates if customer responses to some survey questions (e.g. income, age, etc.) enable the data analyst to predict customers' brand preference. The methods used for this project have wide applicability to the data mining tasks in nearly all business sectors and real-world applications. The skills practiced in this project represent current professional practice and include:

- Applying data mining in e-commerce (e.g. profitability prediction, customer segmentation, product selection strategy)
- Preprocessing data for data mining (e.g., applying filters, addressing missing data)
- Using data mining tools and different classifiers (e.g., k-nearest neighbor, decision trees, support vector machines) to develop predictive models
- Using the Python programming language
- Using the Sciki-learn machine learning package 
- Applying machine learning techniques to classification problems
- Optimizing classifiers by adjusting and testing classifier parameters
- Applying cross-validation methods
- Assessing the predictive performance of classifiers by examining key error metrics
- Comparing and selecting different predictive models
- Applying predictive models to test sets
- Presenting data mining results to management

### 1.2 Path of the learning experience

The patterns in the data has been explored in order to create models to predict new events, like customer product preferences. The experience with machine-learning algorithms has been deepened; how to optimize the initial performance of a classifier by adjusting its parameters has been practised. 

## 2. Exploring data

After loading the "CompleteResponses" dataset, some information of the dataset is as below:

Data Types:

zipcode      int64
credit     float64
brand        int64
dtype: object

Rows and Columns:
(9898, 7)

Column Names:
Index(['salary', 'age', 'elevel', 'car', 'zipcode', 'credit', 'brand'], dtype='object')
